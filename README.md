# AtlasSDK

AtlasSDK is a modular C++ library designed as a foundation for building game engines and high-performance game systems.  
It provides a set of reusable modules that can be integrated easily into any project, offering a solid starting point for engine-level programming.

## Overview

The library currently includes:

- **Core Vectors**: 2D and 3D vector math with basic operations.
- **Shapes & Collision**: Simple primitives such as boxes and spheres for collision detection.
- **Math Utilities**: Helper functions and constants commonly used in engine programming.

Each module is designed to be independent and easy to integrate, so you can pick and use only the components you need.

## Goals

AtlasSDK aims to provide a clean, maintainable foundation for future engine development.  
Planned expansions include:

- Transformations and quaternion math
- Raycasting and simple physics
- Input and game loop utilities

The library is intended as part of my 2026 portfolio focused on engine programming.
